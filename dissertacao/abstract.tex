This dissertation presents a new mixed integer linear programming model for the design of optical communication networks. This is a extensive modeling,
which includes the design of logical and physical topology, routing of traffic demands, in addition to routing and wavelength assignment. The formulation
supports multiple connections between each pair of network nodes, whether in the physical or logic topology. In its basic version, the model minimizes
installation's cost of the physical network and the  operation's cost of the network designed. However, its formulation allows  explore various metrics such
as network's congestion, which was used for comparison with literature. This work presents results of experiments in order to validate the efficiency of
this formulation with respect to quality of solutions and computational performance of previous work on the same subject. Also presented is a new way to
obtain lower bounds to congestion, with very tiny computational's cost, whose efficiency contrasts with the options found in literature.

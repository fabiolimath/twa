Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) has become the dominant transport layer technology for next-generation backbone networks due to its
unprecedented capacity scalability. As a result, there is a pressing need to investigate lightpath provisioning in multi-domain DWDM networks. Although
inter-domain provisioning has been well-studied for packet/cell-switching networks, the wavelength dimension (along with wavelength conversion) presents
many added challenges. To address these concerns, a detailed GMPLS-based hierarchical routing framework for provisioning transparent/translucent/opaque
multi-domain DWDM networks is presented. The scheme adapts topology abstraction to hide internal domain state so as to resolve routing scalability and
security issues. Specifically a novel full-mesh topology abstraction scheme is developed for full wavelength conversion domains, i.e., to disseminate
additional wavelength converter state. Related inter-domain lightpath RWA and signaling schemes are also tabled. Performance analysis results are then
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms along with directions for future research work."

abstract={WDM networks make a very effective utilization of the fiber bandwidth and offer flexible interconnections based on wavelength routing. In high
capacity, dynamic WDM networks, blocking due to wavelength contention can he reduced by wavelength conversion. Wavelength conversion addresses a number of
key issues in WDM networks including transparency, interoperability, and network capacity. Strictly transparent networks offer seamless interconnections
with full reconfigurability and interoperability. Wavelength conversion may be the first obstacle in realizing a transparent WDM network. Among numerous
wavelength conversion techniques reported to date, only a few techniques offer strict transparency. Optoelectronic conversion (O/E-E/O) techniques achieve
limited transparency, yet their mature technologies allow deployment in the near future. The majority of all-optical wavelength conversion techniques also
offer limited transparency but they have a potential advantage over the optoelectronic counterpart in realizing lower packaging costs and crosstalk when
multiple wavelength array configurations are considered. Wavelength conversion by difference-frequency generation offers a full range of transparency while
adding no excess noise to the signal. Recent experiments showed promising results including a spectral inversion and a 90 nm conversion bandwidth. This
paper reviews various wavelength conversion techniques, discusses the advantages and shortcomings of each technique, and addresses their implications for
transparent networks},

abstract={ We consider the problem of designing a network of optical cross-connects (OXCs) to provide end-to-end lightpath services to large numbers of

number of OXCs required and the fiber links among them) and logical topology design (i.e., determine the routing and wavelength assignment for the
lightpaths among the LSRs). Unlike previous studies which were limited to small topologies with a handful of nodes and a few tens of lightpaths, we have
applied our algorithms to networks with hundreds or thousands of LSRs and with a number of lightpaths that is an order of magnitude larger than the number
of LSRs. In order to characterize the performance of our algorithms, we have developed lower bounds which can be computed efficiently. We present numerical
results for up to 1000 LSRs and for a wide range of system parameters such as the number of wavelengths per fiber, the number of transceivers per LSR, and
the number of ports per OXC. The results indicate that it is possible to build large-scale optical networks with rich connectivity in a cost-effective

In this paper we propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for designing virtual topologies of wavelength-routed optical networks,
considering as objective function the minimization of the traffic electronically forwarded at the network nodes. Our goal is twofold. Firstly, to reduce
packet router processing requirements of the electronic routers, and secondly, to get the most transparent traffic distribution for a given traffic matrix,
using the available optical resources at the nodes. The proposed formulation was applied successfully to reasonable sized networks yielding optimal
solutions in a few minutes. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first report on optimizing virtual topology and traffic routing of large
optical networks with a low computational cost MILP formulation."

in this paper) can be dealt with. Furthermore, different combinations of optimization models and objective functions can be investigated in a modular
manner. Secondly, the mechanisms proposed to combine the problems allow to keep track of the global design problem when solving each individual step.},

abstract={Planning and optimization of WDM networks has raised much interest among the research community in the last years. Integer linear programming
(ILP) is the most used exact method to perform this task and many studies have been published concerning this issue. Unfortunately, many works have shown
that, even for small networks, the ILP formulations can easily overwhelm the capabilities of today state-of-the-art computing facilities. So in this paper
we focus our attention on ILP model computational efficiency in order to provide a more effective tool in view of direct planning or other benchmarking
applications. Our formulation exploits flow aggregation and consists in a new ILP formulation that allows us to reach optimal solutions with less
computational effort compared to other ILP approaches. This formulation applies to multifiber mesh networks with or without wavelength conversion. After
presenting the formulation we discuss the results obtained in the optimization of case-study networks.},

investigate the issue of planning and optimization ofWDM networks with DPP. Integer linear programming (ILP), in particular, is one of the most common exact
method to solve the design optimization problem for protected WDM networks. Traditional ILP formalizations to solve this problem rely on the classical flow
or route formulation approaches, but both these approaches suffer from a excessively high computational burden. In this paper, we present a
variable-aggregation method that has the ability of significantly reducing the complexity of the traditional flow formulation. We compare also the
computational burden of flow formulation with variable aggregation both with the classical flow and route formulations. The comparison is carried out by
applying the three alternative methods to the optimization of two case-study networks.},

abstract={The problem of designing a logical topology over a wavelength-routed all-optical network (AON) physical topology is studied. The physical topology
consists of the nodes and fiber links in the network. On an AON physical topology, we can set up lightpaths between pairs of nodes, where a lightpath
represents a direct optical connection without any intermediate electronics. The set of lightpaths along with the nodes constitutes the logical topology.
For a given network physical topology and traffic pattern, our objective is to design the logical topology and the routing algorithm so as to minimize the
network congestion while constraining the average delay seen by a source-destination pair and the amount of processing required at the nodes (degree of the
logical topology). Ignoring the delay constraints can result in fairly convoluted logical topologies with very long delays. On the other hand, in all our
examples, imposing it results in a minimal increase in congestion. While the number of wavelengths required to imbed the resulting logical topology on the
physical all optical topology is also a constraint in general, we find that in many cases of interest this number can be quite small. We formulate the
combined logical topology design and routing problem described above as a mixed integer linear programming problem which we then solve for a number of cases
of a six-node network. This programming problem is split into two subproblems: logical topology design, and routing. We then compare the performance of
several heuristic topology design algorithms against that of randomly generated topologies, as well as lower bounds},

needed to assign channels to the lightpaths. If the network has full wavelength conversion capabilities, then lambda;max wavelengths are sufficient to
perform the channel assignment. Ring networks with fixed wavelength conversion capability within the nodes are proposed that can support all lightpath sets
with load lambda;max at most W-1, where W is the number of wavelengths in each link. Ring networks with a small additional amount of wavelength conversion
capability within the nodes are also proposed that allow the support of any set of lightpaths with load lambda;max at most W. A star network is also
proposed with fixed wavelength conversion capability at its hub node that can support all lightpath sets with load lambda;max at most W. These results are
extended to tree networks and networks with arbitrary topologies. This provides evidence that significant improvements in traffic-carrying capacity can be
obtained in WDM networks by providing very limited wavelength conversion capability within the network},

is emphasized. Optical WDM Networks is a textbook for graduate level courses. Its focus is on the networking aspects of optical networking, but it also
includes coverage of physical layers in optical networks. The author introduces WDM and its enabling technologies and discusses WDM local, access, metro,
and long-haul network architectures. Each chapter is self-contained, has problems at the end of each chapter, and the material is organized for self study
as well as classroom use. The material is the most recent and timely in capturing the state-of-the-art in the fast-moving field of optical WDM networking.",

 OPTabstracts = "Transmission-Efficient Design and Management of Wavelength-Routed Optical Networks is a comprehensive treatment of the impact of
transmission impairments on the design and management of wavelength-routed optical networks. It considers mesh-type network topologies and presents
efficient algorithms and protocols for cost-effective deployment. Starting with transparent networks, this work focuses on power implications such as
cross-connect design, device allocation problems, and management issues. In this all-optical model, a power-efficient design space, based on reduction in
overall cost and ease of network management, is presented. This design concept, motivates various switch architectures and different optimization problems.
Problems motivated by this design concept are addressed from both their theoretical and experimental aspects. After that, the book departs from pure
transparent networks and allows for signal regeneration at some strategic locations in the network. Efficient design algorithms and signaling protocols are
proposed which take advantage of the non-homogeneous nature of optical resources. Transmission-Efficient Design and Management of Wavelength-Routed Optical
Networks is an invaluable resource targeted towards practitioners, researchers, and students from telecommunications, computer science, engineering, and
networking with interest in the realistic deployment of optical networks in the metro and the backbone.",

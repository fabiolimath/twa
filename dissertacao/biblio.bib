                   optical networks},

  abstract       = {The problem of designing a logical topology over a
                   wavelength-routed all-optical network (AON) physical
                   topology is studied. The physical topology consists of
                   the nodes and fiber links in the network. On an AON
                   physical topology, we can set up lightpaths between
                   pairs of nodes, where a lightpath represents a direct
                   optical connection without any intermediate
                   electronics. The set of lightpaths along with the nodes
                   constitutes the logical topology. For a given network
                   physical topology and traffic pattern, our objective is
                   to design the logical topology and the routing
                   algorithm so as to minimize the network congestion
                   while constraining the average delay seen by a
                   source-destination pair and the amount of processing
                   required at the nodes (degree of the logical topology).
                   Ignoring the delay constraints can result in fairly
                   convoluted logical topologies with very long delays. On
                   the other hand, in all our examples, imposing it
                   results in a minimal increase in congestion. While the
                   number of wavelengths required to imbed the resulting
                   logical topology on the physical all optical topology
                   is also a constraint in general, we find that in many
                   cases of interest this number can be quite small. We
                   formulate the combined logical topology design and
                   routing problem described above as a mixed integer
                   linear programming problem which we then solve for a
                   number of cases of a six-node network. This programming
                   problem is split into two subproblems: logical topology
                   design, and routing. We then compare the performance of
                   several heuristic topology design algorithms against
                   that of randomly generated topologies, as well as lower
                   bounds},

                   the traffic electronically forwarded at the network

                   the available optical resources at the nodes. The

                   next-generation backbone networks due to its
                   unprecedented capacity scalability. As a result, there
                   is a pressing need to investigate lightpath
                   provisioning in multi-domain DWDM networks. Although
                   inter-domain provisioning has been well-studied for
                   packet/cell-switching networks, the wavelength
                   dimension (along with wavelength conversion) presents
                   many added challenges. To address these concerns, a
                   detailed GMPLS-based hierarchical routing framework for
                   provisioning transparent/translucent/opaque
                   multi-domain DWDM networks is presented. The scheme
                   adapts topology abstraction to hide internal domain
                   state so as to resolve routing scalability and security
                   issues. Specifically a novel full-mesh topology
                   abstraction scheme is developed for full wavelength
                   conversion domains, i.e., to disseminate additional
                   wavelength converter state. Related inter-domain
                   lightpath RWA and signaling schemes are also tabled.
                   Performance analysis results are then presented to

                   not only devices that perform packet switching, but
                   also those that perform switching in the time,
                   wavelength, and space domains. The development of GMPLS
                   requires modifications to current signaling and routing
                   protocols. It has also triggered the development of new
                   protocols such as the Link Management protocol. We
                   present the traffic engineering enhancements to the
                   Open Shortest Path First Internet routing protocol and
                   ISIS Intradomain Routing Protocol, two popular routing
                   protocols, to support GMPLS. We present the concepts of
                   generalized interfaces, label-switched path hierarchy,
                   and link bundling intended to improve GMPLS
                   scalability. We also discuss the Link Management
                   Protocol which can be used to make the underlying links
                   more manageable},

                   multiplexed (WDM) networks with limited wavelength
                   conversion that can efficiently support lightpaths
                   (connections) between nodes. Each lightpath follows a
                   route in a network and must be assigned a channel on
                   each link along the route. The load lambda;max of a set
                   of lightpaths is the maximum over all links of the
                   number of lightpaths that use the link. At least
                   lambda;max wavelengths will be needed to assign
                   channels to the lightpaths. If the network has full
                   wavelength conversion capabilities, then lambda;max
                   wavelengths are sufficient to perform the channel
                   assignment. Ring networks with fixed wavelength
                   conversion capability within the nodes are proposed
                   that can support all lightpath sets with load
                   lambda;max at most W-1, where W is the number of
                   wavelengths in each link. Ring networks with a small
                   additional amount of wavelength conversion capability
                   within the nodes are also proposed that allow the
                   support of any set of lightpaths with load lambda;max
                   at most W. A star network is also proposed with fixed
                   wavelength conversion capability at its hub node that
                   can support all lightpath sets with load lambda;max at
                   most W. These results are extended to tree networks and
                   networks with arbitrary topologies. This provides
                   evidence that significant improvements in
                   traffic-carrying capacity can be obtained in WDM
                   networks by providing very limited wavelength

                   lightpath services to large numbers of label switched
                   routers (LSRs). We present a set of heuristic
                   algorithms to address the combined problem of physical
                   topology design (i.e., determine the number of OXCs
                   required and the fiber links among them) and logical
                   topology design (i.e., determine the routing and
                   wavelength assignment for the lightpaths among the
                   LSRs). Unlike previous studies which were limited to
                   small topologies with a handful of nodes and a few tens
                   of lightpaths, we have applied our algorithms to
                   networks with hundreds or thousands of LSRs and with a
                   number of lightpaths that is an order of magnitude
                   larger than the number of LSRs. In order to
                   characterize the performance of our algorithms, we have
                   developed lower bounds which can be computed
                   efficiently. We present numerical results for up to
                   1000 LSRs and for a wide range of system parameters
                   such as the number of wavelengths per fiber, the number
                   of transceivers per LSR, and the number of ports per
                   OXC. The results indicate that it is possible to build
                   large-scale optical networks with rich connectivity in
                   a cost-effective manner, using relatively few but

                   the design and management of wavelength-routed optical
                   networks. It considers mesh-type network topologies and
                   presents efficient algorithms and protocols for
                   cost-effective deployment. Starting with transparent
                   networks, this work focuses on power implications such
                   as cross-connect design, device allocation problems,
                   and management issues. In this all-optical model, a
                   power-efficient design space, based on reduction in
                   overall cost and ease of network management, is
                   presented. This design concept, motivates various
                   switch architectures and different optimization
                   problems. Problems motivated by this design concept are
                   addressed from both their theoretical and experimental
                   aspects. After that, the book departs from pure
                   transparent networks and allows for signal regeneration
                   at some strategic locations in the network. Efficient
                   design algorithms and signaling protocols are proposed

                   link failure may cause the failure of several
                   high-bit-rate optical channels, thereby leading to
                   large data loss. Recently, various protection and
                   restoration mechanisms have been proposed to
                   efficiently deal with this problem in mesh networks.
                   Among them, dedicated path protection (DPP) is a
                   promising candidate because of its ultra-fast
                   restoration time and robustness. In this work we
                   investigate the issue of planning and optimization
                   ofWDM networks with DPP. Integer linear programming
                   (ILP), in particular, is one of the most common exact
                   method to solve the design optimization problem for
                   protected WDM networks. Traditional ILP formalizations
                   to solve this problem rely on the classical flow or
                   route formulation approaches, but both these approaches
                   suffer from a excessively high computational burden. In
                   this paper, we present a variable-aggregation method
                   that has the ability of significantly reducing the
                   complexity of the traditional flow formulation. We
                   compare also the computational burden of flow
                   formulation with variable aggregation both with the
                   classical flow and route formulations. The comparison
                   is carried out by applying the three alternative
                   methods to the optimization of two case-study networks.},

                   fiber bandwidth and offer flexible interconnections
                   based on wavelength routing. In high capacity, dynamic
                   WDM networks, blocking due to wavelength contention can
                   he reduced by wavelength conversion. Wavelength
                   conversion addresses a number of key issues in WDM
                   networks including transparency, interoperability, and
                   network capacity. Strictly transparent networks offer
                   seamless interconnections with full reconfigurability
                   and interoperability. Wavelength conversion may be the
                   first obstacle in realizing a transparent WDM network.
                   Among numerous wavelength conversion techniques
                   reported to date, only a few techniques offer strict
                   transparency. Optoelectronic conversion (O/E-E/O)
                   techniques achieve limited transparency, yet their
                   mature technologies allow deployment in the near
                   future. The majority of all-optical wavelength
                   conversion techniques also offer limited transparency
                   but they have a potential advantage over the
                   optoelectronic counterpart in realizing lower packaging
                   costs and crosstalk when multiple wavelength array
                   configurations are considered. Wavelength conversion by
                   difference-frequency generation offers a full range of
                   transparency while adding no excess noise to the
                   signal. Recent experiments showed promising results
                   including a spectral inversion and a 90 nm conversion
                   bandwidth. This paper reviews various wavelength
                   conversion techniques, discusses the advantages and
                   shortcomings of each technique, and addresses their
                   implications for transparent networks},

                   Unfortunately, many works have shown that, even for

                   order to provide a more effective tool in view of
                   direct planning or other benchmarking applications. Our
                   formulation exploits flow aggregation and consists in a
                   new ILP formulation that allows us to reach optimal
                   solutions with less computational effort compared to
                   other ILP approaches. This formulation applies to
                   multifiber mesh networks with or without wavelength
                   conversion. After presenting the formulation we discuss
                   the results obtained in the optimization of case-study
                   networks.},

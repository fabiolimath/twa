This paper presents a methodology for logical and physical design of optical communication networks with hierarchical topology of meshes. Are determined 
logical and physical topologies, and routing and designation of wavelengths, depending on the geographic location of network nodes. The methodology 
proposal consists of three steps that comprise a meta-heuristics, statistical inference and a model of mixed-integer linear programming. The first one 
genetic algorithm defines the hierarchical structure of the optical network. Then, a statistical procedure to obtain estimates 
parameters of interest that will be used to define quality criteria for the project, limiting the model variables 
mathematical programming resolved at the last step. We present results of experiments in order to validate the efficiency of this formulation on the 
computacinal performance and also regarding the quality of solutions, based on comparison of lower bounds for the metrics 
to be optimized. 

Keywords: optical networks, combinatorial optimization.

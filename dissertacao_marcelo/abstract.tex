\begin{abstract}

In this work we present a methodology for logical and physical design of optical  networks based on mesh hierarchical topologies. The proposed  method can,
simultaneously, design the logical and physical topologies, and perform routing and wavelength assignment. It is based on  three steps: the metaheuristics, the
statistical inference and the model of mixed-integer linear programming. The first one genetic algorithm defines the hierarchical structure of the optical
network. Then, a statistical procedure to obtain estimate parameters of interest that will be used to define quality criteria for the project, limiting the
model variables for the mathematical programming. We present results of experiments in order to validate the efficiency of this formulation on the computational
performance and also regarding the quality of solutions, based on comparison of lower bounds for the metrics to be optimized.

Keywords: Optical networks, Combinatorial optimization.
